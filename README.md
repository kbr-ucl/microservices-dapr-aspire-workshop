# Dapr & Aspire workshop

Part one of this workshop is a clone of [Diagrid's Dapr Workshop](https://github.com/diagrid-labs/dapr-workshop)

Part two is Aspirefying the Diagrid's Dapr workshop. Here Aspire is added to the Diagrid's Dapr workshop projects.

Finally Diagrid's Dapr workshop [Workflow](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/workflow/workflow-overview/) project is refactored to an Aspire project where all messages are send via asynchrony messaging (messages queues).

## Dapr Dashboard
As you work through the workshop challenges, use the Dapr Dashboard to monitor your services.


### The Dapr Dashboard

The Dapr Dashboard is a lightweight, web-based user interface designed to provide real-time visibility into applications running with the Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr). It serves as an essential tool for developers and operators to visualize, inspect, and debug their distributed systems, particularly during local development.

The dashboard connects to the Dapr control plane (or local environment) to gather and present information about the Dapr sidecars running alongside your application services.

#### Key Capabilities and Features:

- **Application Overview:** It lists all currently running Dapr applications, showing their unique App IDs, Dapr ports (HTTP and gRPC), and current health status.
- **Component Inspection:** It allows users to view all configured Dapr components—such as state stores, pub/sub brokers, output bindings, and secret stores—and inspect their initialization status and metadata configurations.
- **Sidecar Logs:** The dashboard provides direct access to the logs generated by the Dapr sidecar process for each application. This is crucial for troubleshooting connection issues, component errors, or failures in service invocations.
- **Service Invocation Graph:** It offers a graphical visualization of the relationships between services, showing how different applications are calling each other through Dapr.
- **Actor Viewing:** For applications using Dapr Actors, the dashboard displays information about registered actor types and hosted actors.

#### How it is used:

The dashboard is typically launched via the Dapr Command Line Interface (CLI) using the command `dapr dashboard`. Once running, it opens in a local web browser (usually on port 8080), giving developers an immediate "under the hood" view of their Dapr ecosystem without needing to sift through raw terminal output.


### In Summary

The **Dapr Dashboard** is a convenient UI for:

*   Understanding how your microservices interact
*   Inspecting configuration, state, and metadata
*   Troubleshooting and observing runtime behavior
*   Monitoring Dapr control‑plane components (in Kubernetes)




## Dapr Workshop - introduction

![Dapr sidecar](imgs/dapr_sidecar_pixelart.png)

Welcome to Diagrid's [Dapr](https://dapr.io/) Workshop! This repository contains a set of hands-on challenges designed to introduce you to Dapr's most popular APIs and give you a starting point to build your own distributed applications.

Microservices architectures are popular for a variety of reasons - they enable polyglot development, are easily scaled, and perform simple, focused tasks. However, as the number of microservices grows, so does the complexity of the system. Managing security, observability, and resiliency becomes increasingly challenging, often leading to the same problems being solved over and over again.

Dapr addresses these challenges by providing a set of APIs for building distributed systems with best practices for microservices baked in. Leveraging Dapr allows you to reduce development time while building reliable, observable, and secure distributed applications with ease. Let’s dive in and explore how Dapr can simplify your journey to distributed systems excellence!

### Goals

On completion of this workshop, you will understand how three of the most popular Dapr Building Block APIs work: [State Management](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/state-management/), [Service Invocation](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/service-invocation/), [Publish/Subscribe](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/pubsub/), and [Workflow](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/workflow/).

You will build five microservices to simulate the process of ordering a pizza:

- The `pizza-storefront` service serves as an entry point for customers to order a new pizza.
- The `pizza-kitchen` service has a single responsibility, to cook the pizza.
- The `pizza-delivery` service manages the delivery process, from picking up the pizza at the kitchen to delivering it to the customer's doorstep.
- The `pizza-order` service manages the order status in the state store.
- The `pizza-workflow` service orchestrates the order steps, from ordering to delivery.

### Challenges

#### Challenge 1: State Management

You will start the workshop by creating the `pizza-order` service. It is responsible for managing the  order state and saving it to a Redis database, using the [Dapr State Management Building Block](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/state-management/). You will learn how to create a Dapr Component specification, and how to use the Dapr SDK to save and retrieve an item using the State Store API.

#### Challenge 2: Service Invocation

This challenge will focus on synchronous communication between services using the [Dapr Service Invocation Building Block](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/service-invocation/). After the pizza order is saved in the database, you will create the three following services: `pizza-storefront`, `pizza-kitchen`, and `pizza-delivery`. `pizza-storefront` will invoke the endpoints from the other services to cook and deliver the pizza.

#### Challenge 3: Pub/Sub

In the third challenge, you will add a Pub/Sub component to the `pizza-order` service. You will use the [Dapr Publish & Subscribe Building Block](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/pubsub/) to publish events to a Redis Streams message broker from `pizza-storefront`, `pizza-kitchen`, and `pizza-delivery`. These events represent each stage in the pizza order, cooking, and delivery process. For every event published, the `pizza-order` service will subscribe to it and update the current order status in the Redis State Store.

Challenge 3 is in two variants - declarative pub/sub and programmatic pub/sub. In short:

- Declarative pub/sub:
  - The subscription is defined in an **external file**. The declarative approach removes the Dapr dependency from your code and **allows for existing applications to subscribe to topics, without having to change code.**
- Programmatic pub/sub:
  - Subscription is defined in the **user code**. The programmatic approach implements the static subscription and requires an endpoint in your code.



#### Challenge 4: Workflows

Now you will modify the application to orchestrate the process of ordering, cooking, and delivering the pizza to use [Dapr's Workflow Building Block](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/workflow/). With that you will guarantee that every step happens in a particular order. A validation state will also be created to guarantee that the pizza was cooked properly before it is delivered.

## Dapr & Aspire - introduction

[Aspire](https://aspire.dev/) is a framework for building **cloud-native applications** in .NET with a strong focus on **observability, orchestration, and developer productivity**. It complements Dapr by providing tooling and patterns to manage distributed applications more effectively.

By integrating Aspire into this workshop, you gain:

- **Unified orchestration**
   Aspire makes it easy to define and run multiple microservices together, handling dependencies and startup order automatically.
- **Enhanced observability**
   Aspire provides built-in dashboards for logs, metrics, and traces, helping you monitor the health of your pizza-ordering microservices at a glance.
- **Simplified configuration**
   Connection strings, secrets, and environment variables can be centrally managed, reducing duplication and configuration drift across services.
- **Developer productivity**
   Aspire streamlines the local development experience, so you can run your Dapr-enabled services with minimal setup and focus on solving the challenges.

#### How Aspire fits into the Pizza Workshop

- The **Aspire AppHost** can orchestrate all five pizza microservices (`storefront`, `kitchen`, `delivery`, `order`, and `workflow`) together with their Dapr sidecars.
- Aspire’s **dashboard** lets you visualize service dependencies and monitor the state of your pizza orders in real time.
- You can extend the workshop by adding Aspire components for Redis, message brokers, or other external resources, making the environment closer to production scenarios.

## Updating Aspire Packages

A PowerShell script is provided to update all Aspire-related NuGet packages and SDK versions across the solution. It updates the central `Directory.Packages.props` and the `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` version in each AppHost `.csproj` file.

### Prerequisites

The script requires **PowerShell 7+** (`pwsh`). If you only have Windows PowerShell 5.1, install it with:

```powershell
winget install Microsoft.PowerShell
```

### Usage

Run from the repository root using `pwsh`:

```powershell
# Preview changes (no files modified)
pwsh ./after/Update-AspirePackages.ps1 -DryRun

# Apply updates to latest stable versions
pwsh ./after/Update-AspirePackages.ps1

# Pin to a specific Aspire SDK version
pwsh ./after/Update-AspirePackages.ps1 -TargetVersion "9.2.0"
```
